# Blogging-website-using-express
This is the simple blogging site I have made using Express, ejs, express-session, fs, path.
In this I have made two users one for author and one for admin.
author has the ability to create a new post or update his previous post and on the main page only his own blogs will be shown whereas in the admin view all posts will be shown and admin can delete any of the post.
I have made use of ejs for dynamic rendering of webpage
